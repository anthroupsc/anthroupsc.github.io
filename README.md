A Course on Anthropolgy
=========
I am working on this project as a productive way to document all that I have learned during my last four years with Anthropology.  

This project could be read in any order that pleases the reader. It could even be treated as a place where case studies and the like could be noted down.

Due credit would be given accordingly. However, in cases where such information is not available, the original creators can contact me at [Hashin Jithu](mailto:mail@hashin.me?subject=AnthroUPSC%20Credit%20Attribution)


The project will always be free. It could be shared, printed or distributed freely. If possible, a link to this website could be added so that those who use the material can always access the most updated version.
