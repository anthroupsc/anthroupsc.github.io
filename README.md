A Course on Anthropolgy
=========
The author working on this project as a productive way to document all that he has learned during his last four years with Anthropology. He acknowledges that he has never been a consistent student. He has also strayed away from the subject for long. 

However, the subject has inspired him so much so that he has decided to document his experiences totally. Full disclosure has been made that he subject was studied along the UPSC syllabus. But at no point did he restrained himself to 'stick to the syllabus'. This was simply because such an approach doesn't work for him.

This project could be read in any order that pleases the reader. It could even be treated as a place where case studies and the like could be noted down. As he is always in the process of learning, this project is treated as a repository of all notes collected from whatever source that is available. 

Due credit would be given accordingly. However, in cases where such information is not available, the original creators can contact him at [Hashin Jithu](mailto:mail@hashin.me?subject=AnthroUPSC%20Credit%20Attribution)


The project will always be free. I hold no right over the content and anybody can share and redistribute it according to their will.
