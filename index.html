      <section>
        <p>This website contains all the resources that I have collected in my journey with Anthropology so far. It will broadly follow the UPSC syllabus, but will also contain a few general topics that has caught my attention.</p>
        <p>This site is maintained by <a href="http://www.hashin.me" target="_blank">Hashin Jithu</a> and is designed as an opensource project. It is hosted on Github pages and will be free forever. The site is designed based on the style adopted by Edward Tufte in his handouts.</p>
        <p> The style is adopted from the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css" target="_blank">tufte-css project</a>. If you feel like contributing or sending in any suggestions, you can <a href="mailto:mail@hashin.me?subject=AnthroUPSC%20Suggestions" target="_blank"> email me</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>This document outlines the contents of the course. Every topic will have page, that could be independently read. There will be resources, case studies and excerpts from answer copies that I have read. I will also add some general reading that could help understand the subject better.</p>

        <p>If you have read majority of your syllabus here and feels like contributing, you can <a href="mailto:mail@hashin.me?subject=AnthroUPSC%20Collaboration" target="_blank"> email me</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="figures">Approach</h2>
        <p>The subject matter will be presented in minimal words with an intention to learn and document rather than make a comprehensive guide that will cover the entire subject.</p>
        <p>The focus will be to present as much examples, case studies and angles to make the subject matter as clear as possible. Since we deal with a lot of theories which are more like the relic of the past, we might try an historic approach as and when it is required.</p>

We'd try to find images like that of the <em>Australopithecus Sediba</em> here, which gives us an understanding of the present understanding in the subject.</p>
        <p>The graphics and images used in the project are carefully picked to enhance the quality of understanding. Rather than cover the whole of subject matter, the priority is to cover it in a simple, aesthetically pleasing manner.</p>
